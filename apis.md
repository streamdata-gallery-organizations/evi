  Evi, the digital personal assistant currently available for both iOS and Android.Evi
  is the successor to the True Knowledge Answer Engine and utilises natural conversational
  input to allow a user to ask for information or perform tasks by speaking in a totally
  natural manner without pre-programmed voice commands.Evi utilises a variety of information
  sources including her own database of nearly a billion facts as well as numerous
  external resources.True Knowledge&#8217;s technology is non statistical, meaning
  that it knows when it cannot understand the user&#8217;s question or provide an
  answer. This it allows it to complement existing search technologies producing its
  direct answers when it can and other results such as standard internet search results
  when it cannot.
